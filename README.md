Personalized Healthcare Recommendations for Women Using Clustering

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to provide personalized healthcare recommendations for women by using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to segment individuals based on health needs and preferences. The final output is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to explore recommendations based on their health data.

🚀 FEATURES

Data Preprocessing & Clustering: Cleans and prepares healthcare data for clustering.

Machine Learning Models: Implements Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

Personalized Recommendations: Provides tailored healthcare insights based on clusters.

Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit and Plotly for visualization.

Deployment: Can be deployed using Streamlit Cloud or local execution.
